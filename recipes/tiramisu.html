    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert made of coffee-soaked ladyfinger biscuits layered with a light, creamy mixture of mascarpone, eggs, and sugar, then dusted generously with cocoa powder. Rich, airy, and slightly bitter from the espresso, it's known for its luxurious but balanced flavour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>

        <li>Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more.</li>
